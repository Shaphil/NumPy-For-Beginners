Getting started guide to NumPy for beginners. NumPy is a Python library for mathematical calculations and operations. This repository is based on a tutorial by Keith Galli, that touches on the following,

- The Basics (creating arrays, shape, size, data type)
- Accessing/Changing Specific Elements, Rows, Columns, etc (slicing)
- Initializing Different Arrays (1s, 0s, full, random, etc...)
- Basic Mathematics (arithmetic, trigonometry, etc.)
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Reorganizing Arrays (reshape, vstack, hstack)
- Load data in from a file
- Advanced Indexing and Boolean Masking
